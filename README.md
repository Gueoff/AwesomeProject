This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

### Detox
This project contains tests using [Detox](https://github.com/wix/Detox)
A compiled version of the app is needed in order to run these tests. There are two ways of running these tests:

* With a dev env, using the latest changes before building. This is useful to implement tests while developing.

In order to make this work we need to build the debug app, start development server in e2e mode and run tests in debug mode:

First you need to get the detox cli
```
npm install detox-cli --global
```

Then, you have to know in which simulator you want to launch the tests by editing .detox.js file.

devices: {
simulator: {
device: {
type: 'YOUR_IOS_DEVICE'
}
},
emulator: {
device: {
avdName: 'YOUR_ANDROID_DEVICE',
}
}
},

Launch your device and the development server
```bash
MY_APP_MODE=mocked npx react-native start
```

* With the application built. This is useful in a CI/CD pipeline, to test that the app is working correctly.

With this approach, the app will not need the development server, since the code will be already compiled.

```bash
# Android debug tests
npm run e2e:build:android:debug
npm run e2e:run:android:debug

# iOS debug tests
npm run e2e:build:ios:debug
npm run e2e:run:ios:debug
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
